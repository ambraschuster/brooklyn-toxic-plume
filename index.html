			<p class="intro">The Meeker Avenue Plume, a large underground contamination site left by the neighborhood’s history of dry cleaning and metalworking industry, was first discovered in 2007 and got declared a national Superfund site in 2022. This means it is officially one of the most hazardous toxic waste sites in the U.S. and gets prioritized for cleanup under federal oversight and funding.  Since then, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been in charge of investigating the full extent of the contamination and will ultimately develop a cleanup plan.

			<!-- Regular body paragraph -->
			<p>
				Despite being around for so long and affecting up to 1,000 buildings, many people living and working in and around the Meeker Avenue Plume still don’t know that they are on contaminated ground. They don’t know about the invisible chemical vapors that can seep through foundation cracks and dirt floors into their homes. And they are unaware of the <a href="https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/764692.pdf">health hazards</a> these vapors can cause. 
			</p>
			<p>They don’t know because many landlords in the area have looked the other way, especially because they are not required by law to inform tenants about the potential harms of living near, or directly on top of, a Superfund site. Moreover, their resistance to get their houses tested stalls remediation and the cleanup process.

For instance, they can impair male fertility or cause birth defects if exposure occurs during pregnancy. Inhaling the vapors can also lead to dizziness or eye irritation, such as itching and watery eyes.

					<figcaption class="graphic-text">To determine whether a building is affected by vapor intrusion and needs mitigation vents, the EPA must take air samples inside. So far, <strong>240 out of 1,000 buildings have been tested</strong>. While this testing is free, landlords must give permission. However, they often deny access, fearing it could hurt property values — leaving residents uninformed and anxious about their homes’ safety.

Now, things are starting to move. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez is reportedly discussing a <strong>bill that would compel landlords to post visible notices about nearby Superfund sites in their buildings</strong> and share testing results with residents.</figcaption>
